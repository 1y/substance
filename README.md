Substance
================================================================================

Substance is a fully web-based document authoring and publishing platform.

![Substance](http://f.cl.ly/items/3y2t2I3f0E2U1Y3e0S0n/Screen%20Shot%202012-06-05%20at%208.28.08%20AM.png)

With Substance, writers, journalists, scientists and everyone else who's interested in publishing can use an open platform for writing and sharing articles. Document authoring used to take place in word processors on the Desktop like MS Word or Open Office. We believe that today this can all be be done in the browser, in a simpler, more collaborative way.

**Semantic Editing**

Unlike traditional word-processors, Substance focuses on content, by leaving the layout part to the system, not the user. Because of the absence of formatting utilities, it suggests structured, content-oriented writing.

**Create once, publish everywhere**

By considering content as data, documents can be shared in many ways. On websites, Tablets, eBook Readers.

**Collaboration**

Substance targets open collaboration. Readers can participate and comment on certain text passages. In future they'll even be able to submit patches, that can be applied by the owner.

**Integration**

Substance exposes documents as data, ready to be compiled into arbitrary output formats ( HTML, PDF,ePub, ...) or integrated with other applications (like websites).



Future
================================================================================

We are more focussing on pushing forward Substance as an open source technology stack (rather than a product). It turned out enabling developers to contribute is key to push a platform forward.

That being said, we're working on an all new [architecture](http://github.com/substance/architecture) for Substance, to solve the issues with the current implementation and to turn it into a flexible toolset anyone can use and customize.

Our new take will feature a generic [document format](http://github.com/substance/document) including a protocol for document manipulation, realtime synchronization based on [Operational Transformation](http://ot.substance.io), a scaleable flexible storage and messaging mechanism, as well as a [framework](http://github.com/substance/composer) for building content composition tools for the browser.

Many people got excited about the idea of Substance, luckily there are a lot of developers among them, passionate about helping with making it happen. It's exciting to see such a huge amount of support for a project you initiated 1.5 years ago.

  Oliver is my former room-mate, and extraordinaire software developer and scientist. He got me excited about graphs, parsers and much more.

  He joined Substance last summer, when he basically [rewrote](https://github.com/substance/letterpress/pull/1) the Substance Letterpress Service in order to use PanDoc. He's also working on a [javascript library](http://ot.substance.io) that provides Operational Transformation.
